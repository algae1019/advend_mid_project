The Whispering Forest
The forest had stood at the edge of town for as long as anyone could remember.
It wasn’t just an ordinary collection of trees; the air inside seemed thicker, the light dimmer.
Legends said that if you ventured too deep, the forest would whisper your darkest fears, calling you further into its depths until you could no longer find your way out.
Ellie had heard the stories her entire life.
As a child, she and her friends would dare each other to take a few steps past the crooked oak at the forest’s entrance.
But now, at seventeen, Ellie no longer believed in bedtime stories—or so she told herself.
Still, something about the forest fascinated her. It pulled at her, like a dream she couldn’t quite remember but couldn’t forget either.
Onst. The air smelled of pine and damp earth, but beneath it was something else—a scent that felt ancient, almost like forgotten secrets waiting to be discovered.
She told herself she was just curious, but deep down, she knew it was more than that.
The forest had been calling her for years, and tonight, she would answe evening, with the sky painted in hues of orange and violet, Ellie stood at the edge of the forest, her heart hammering in her cheer.
With a deep breath, Ellie took her first step beyond the crooked oak.
The canopy above swallowed the last of the sunset, plunging her into shadows.
Each step seemed to echo, even though the ground was soft with moss and fallen leaves.
The forest was quiet, but not the peaceful kind of quiet—this was the silence before a storm, the kind that made your skin prickle.
As she walked deeper, Ellie noticed something strange.
The forest didn’t feel lifeless; it felt... aware. The trees seemed to lean closer, as if listening.
A breeze stirred the leaves, and for a moment, Ellie thought she heard a voice—soft and distant, like a whisper carried on the wind.
“Ellie...” She froze.
It wasn’t possible.
The voice couldn’t be real.
And yet, it sounded familiar.
It sounded like her mother’s voice, though her mother had passed away three years ago.
Ellie’s throat tightened as she scanned the shadows.
“Who’s there?” she whispered, her voice trembling.
The only response was the wind, rustling through the branches, carrying with it a soft, almost playful laugh.
Ellie’s pulse raced, but she couldn’t bring herself to turn back.
Something inside her whispered that if she kept going, she would find the answers she didn’t even know she was looking for.
And so she walked deeper into the forest, leaving the town—and the safety of the known world—behind.
